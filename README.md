# yaml-twine-formatter
A plugin for Twine (https://github.com/scelis/twine) that adds capabilities to import/export from/to flat YAML object. (Useful for external translation management, for example.) Written in Ruby, published as a gem.

So far it only exports Twine -> YAML with section hierarchy preserved in keys.
